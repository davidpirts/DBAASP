# Predictive models for antimicrobial peptides 

This repository implements various machine learning algorithms for classifying peptides as active or non-active against gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, with an eye towards antibiotic 
[drug discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery). See [this link (https://sciforum.net/paper/view/conference/6359)
for an expert-level discussion. 

For non-bioinformaticians (like me), the quick summary of the problem is as follows. Peptides are chains, made out of aminoacids --
